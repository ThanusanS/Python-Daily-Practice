# ✅ What is a Variable?
A variable is a container that stores data values. It allows you to reference and manipulate data in a program.
---
```
x = 5
```
Here, x is a variable and 5 is its value.

📌 Rules for Naming Variables:
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

- Must start with a letter or underscore (_), not a number.

- Case-sensitive (name ≠ Name).

- Avoid Python keywords (like for, if, class, etc.).

```
valid_name = 10      # valid
_name = "Hello"      # valid
2nd_place = 90       # ❌ invalid
```
